Contribution: We study DNN training byL Fourier analysis. Our theoretical frameworkexplains: i) DNN with (stochastic). gradient-based methods often endows low-frequency components of the targetsc function with a higher priority during the training; ii) Small initialization leads[ to good generalizationability of DNN while preservingthe DNN’s ability to ﬁt   any function. These results are further conﬁrmed by experiments of DNNs\n",

      "During the following week Fessenden read little and was too amiably\n",

      "good. Do you think that small head can remember all this tiresome\n",
      "advice?” But put on\n",
      "no airs, even when you are being properly educated by Morris. “He kinder gives me the dumps,” remarked Fritz Nettlebeck, as he filled\n",
      "his pipe in the kitchen that evening. “ I don’t take to people who looks\n",
      "as if their brains was distributed all over them. “You’re gitten imagination,” said Christina, with contempt. She was a\n",
      "sour and elderly virgin, hard-worked, now that her mother was growing\n",
      "old, and disapproving of her brothers in all their phases. “It’s about the only soft spot you’ve got. cried Nettlebeck, bringing his fist\n",
      "down on the table with such violence that Christina’s pile of clean\n",
      "plates rattled, and she gave a wholly feminine shriek. “ She sniffed, muttered something about not being minded to insult her\n",
      "own family, whatever she might think of folks in general, and carried\n",
      "off her dishes to their shelves. “Mr. Abbott,” resumed Nettlebeck, having given his wrath such time to\n",
      "cool as a female could expect, “is a generous and self-sacrificin’\n",
      "father, and he just worships that kid; he’d wear one suit of clothes a\n",
      "year to give him what he needed, and of course keep don’t cost much up\n",
      "here. “That there canoe is a second-handed one, and I got it dirt cheap. Mr.\n",
      "Abbott consulted me about it when he was here last, and asked me to do\n",
      "the best I could, as he’d like the kid to have a canoe if one could\n",
      "be got inside his means. There’s been too many campers in these woods in my time,\n",

      "Like all invalids, Morris had little affection for any one but himself,\n",
      "but what he lacked in human sympathy he atoned for in courtesy of\n",
      "manner and nicety of conscience. He instructed Fessenden until that\n",
      "restless youngster besought Nettlebeck to find him many “chores.” Upon these occasions,\n",
      "Dolf, the younger of the Nettlebeck brothers, always dropped his\n",
      "work and encouraged the sport. “You are a great fighter, Fess,” he began, tactfully; “and it does my\n",
      "poor blood good to watch so much energy explode. I’ve got to make myself understood, and I do, you bet. You are so constituted that if you would learn to control yourself\n",
      "you could command your fellows with little effort; and at least when\n",
      "you fight try not to hate so hard.” Those flung\n",
      "into a fertile crevice by Morris, who took the responsibility very\n",
      "seriously, put out their green heads in time. I suppose one might as well wait till one has\n",
      "a real call to fight,” he remarked to himself with philosophy. “ I guess I wasn’t\n",
      "cut out for a Sunday-school teacher.” Although you poison yourself\n",
      "with the hate you feel while actually fighting, hate is never the\n",
      "motive of battle with you. You like all these boys well enough, but\n",
      "you must find out who is the best man or burst. Find it out some other\n",
      "way--or rather, having decided that point, try others. Did not Napoleon sit aloft on a hill while his hundreds of\n",
      "thousands of nameless minions did the fighting? This evening their upper slopes were\n",
      "white with a late fall of snow. He felt able to go out and conquer\n",
      "the world then and there; but he was modest by an earlier endowment,\n",
      "and the value of a sound education had been impressed upon his\n",
      "responsive mind. The full moon hung low on the reflecting lake. The deer came\n",
      "noiselessly out of the woods and drank. This social triumph was not won without another\n",
      "struggle, partly fistic, partly diplomatic; and Fessenden regarded the\n",
      "issue as his greatest achievement. The\n",
      "immediate result was an indiscriminate slaughter and loud protests from\n",
      "Christina, who viewed an overstocked and gory larder with disfavor. One fine buck was\n",
      "shipped to Mr. Abbott by Nettlebeck. Fessenden had brought it down, and\n",
      "it was the prize of the season. It was the first time he had\n",
      "ever heard sounds in the house at this hour, and even the birds and\n",
      "the cocks were still asleep. The lake was a\n",
      "sheet of ice several feet in depth. How he realized at once that Mrs. Nettlebeck was dead he never knew. He expounded every belief he\n",
      "had investigated. Once a month the church was\n",
      "visited by an itinerant preacher. Fessenden now had his ardent following among the boys of his\n",
      "region, but boys manifest their liking by loyalty, not by sentiment. But now that the magic had gone\n",
      "abruptly from him, and there was nothing to take its place, he felt\n",
      "himself up against the barren rocks of life; for the first time the\n",
      "future seemed to hold vague and unknown terrors, the present to be less\n",
      "than the supremely satisfactory thing he had esteemed it. He went first\n",
      "for consolation to his canoe, whom perhaps he loved the more ardently\n",
      "as her responses held an exciting element of doubt. That is fatal\n",
      "to steady and rounded development. “I should hate it if we had ever been licked. With that to live by we can’t be in need of a trouncing; and\n",
      "of course all other men try to follow in the footsteps of our great\n",
      "ones--there are a lot of others whose lives I haven’t had time to read\n",
      "yet.” But he closed them\n",
      "quickly, and brought down his lids over his cold dreaming eyes. Mr. Abbott opened the door of the stove and poked the fire. It is their enterprise that has made this country\n",
      "great, not the growling of the failures. It is they who encourage\n",
      "and promote industries, whether their employees like their manner\n",
      "of doing it or not. Every working-man on strike is a potential millionaire--in fact\n",
      "as well as in fancy--for this country offers equal chances to all. My son, I think it is time for you to go to bed.” This interval of four years was pricked out by two\n",
      "variations only: the gradually discontinuing visits of his father and\n",
      "the slight change incident upon a letter received from Mr. Abbott on\n",
      "his son’s fifteenth birthday:\n",
      "\n",
      "  “MY DEAR BOY”--(this letter began, in the well-bred but curiously\n",
      "  unexercised handwriting which sometimes made Fessenden wonder if his\n",
      "  father never wrote to any one else)--“It may be some time, perhaps\n",
      "  years, before we meet again. I shall give you no reason now for this\n",
      "  additional separation, so painful to me. I hope and pray that other things may come\n",
      "  as readily to you in due course. “I have now concluded that you are old and strong enough to support\n",
      "  yourself--barring your tuition, which I shall manage to meet. One is that a man always seems to me most\n",
      "  of an ass when smirking on cardboard. Obey him without\n",
      "question--therein lies the success of your future. “A weekly visit from Mr. Abbott--” Morris checked his laugh abruptly. “Your father is not too strong, and hates travelling. But you have\n",
      "brain and imagination; it is odd you should need the regularly\n",
      "administered pap of the ordinary youth.” I can’t help\n",
      "being thankful that it isn’t to be a grocery-store clerk. Neither did he recognize the vacant, the\n",
      "utterly commonplace mind that looked from that sweet unchanging\n",
      "face. Fessenden had produced a tin cup and filled it with the running liquid. They talked disconnectedly of various\n",
      "things, no one of which could Fessenden recall later. She thought\n",
      "this young mountaineer very handsome and clever-looking, and she had\n",
      "a faint romantic preference for tall men; but her poor little body\n",
      "was not destined for reproduction, and her brain was too small for\n",
      "imagination and sentiment. She was vain and liked attention, but she\n",
      "was without guile, and as she had no immediate reason for marrying, her\n",
      "mother keeping a small store comfortably, she encouraged no one of her\n",
      "admirers, while accepting the homage of several as a matter of course. Her voice was sweet\n",
      "and thin; it was only when she raised it that it escaped through her\n",
      "nose. His suddenly conceived and violent passion needed\n",
      "but the lash of pity to transform him from the individual into the\n",
      "type, tumultuous with sentimental desire; the instinct of the strong to\n",
      "protect the beloved weak, keen and quick; pouring into a flimsy shell\n",
      "such an ideal as man knows only in his dreams--the determination to\n",
      "possess this inestimable treasure though the world stood still and the\n",
      "angels warned through brazen trumpets. “I hope this log isn’t damp,” he said anxiously. “ The boys always\n",
      "say I just rattle out anything that comes into my head, and they don’t\n",
      "mind a bit.” I should think”--he blundered\n",
      "somehow through his first compliment--“that anything you said would be\n",
      "about right.” You can\n",
      "get me another cup of that sap if you like.” Then, partly because his emotions were rendering him\n",
      "speechless, partly because he was fired with the primitive desire\n",
      "of the male to show off before the female, he swung his axe to his\n",
      "shoulder and muttered that he guessed he’d better cut down a tree; he\n",
      "was wasting too much time. It hasn’t given any sap for two\n",
      "years, and has been bothering the other trees.” “Well, they are in a way--that is, they’ve often seemed alive to me.” People who live much alone have odd fancies. You appear to be in a hurry--must\n",
      "have wasted time after I left you.” “Of course the trees have to be spiled, but Miss Morton was too tired\n",
      "to walk home. “She didn’t calculate on finding a nurse ready made; she’s real\n",
      "fortunate. You’ll be the next thing, I suppose--he’ll find it quite a\n",
      "relief after so much brain work.” And even then the rosy halo swirled unrent. During the ensuing fortnight he spent\n",
      "every evening at the Hunters’. They were having their first\n",
      "innings, and not even grateful to the cause. Considering the issues, it was fortunate in many respects that\n",
      "Fessenden had the inevitable attack so early in life. At\n",
      "its conclusion Morris spent an hour in composition, the farmer hitched\n",
      "up his buckboard and, in spite of the pressing duties of the season,\n",
      "drove thirty miles to the station and gave the letter to an obliging\n",
      "conductor to post in New York. Grace’s gone, and she won’t\n",
      "come back, neither.” “When you are a rational being once more I shall be glad to see you\n",
      "again and talk it over. I sincerely hope I may be able to help you\n",
      "in some way. But we all have to go through this, my boy. It is to be\n",
      "hoped that puppy-love will prove an equally amenable microbe. Poor Fessenden had not yet reached the analytical stage. He felt shorn, impoverished, hopeless;\n",
      "worse than all, helpless. There was nothing for him; and then he realized that, subconsciously,\n",
      "he had expected Grace to defy her mother and write to him--had believed\n",
      "the separation to be a matter of a few weeks; that the time would come\n",
      "when her demand would be as imperative as his own. He leaped up the\n",
      "stairs to his room and rummaged among the papers on his table; there\n",
      "were fragments of exercises in five languages, dead and alive, brief\n",
      "studies of public men, but there was no letter, even from his father. His prayer\n",
      "was answered so quickly that for a moment he stood as dazed as if he\n",
      "had been transferred abruptly to another planet. Finally\n",
      "he sat down and wrote a long letter to his father. A hint, a\n",
      "stimulus, was all he expected from Morris; the final solution would be\n",
      "found in solitude. If you had even a small income, and purposed to become\n",
      "a man of letters, if you had in you the makings of a professor or a\n",
      "clergyman, I should say Harvard without hesitation, even though you\n",
      "would have to skimp through in a manner that is very humiliating to a\n",
      "gentleman; but I have studied you closely now for seven years, and I\n",
      "cannot associate you with any of the old-fashioned callings. “That is what you would decide after you had been there a year or two. The point is that you would find there special courses on electricity,\n",
      "mechanics, banking, transportation, agriculture, international\n",
      "relations, politics, all the industrial problems. There is still another reason for making yourself familiar\n",
      "with all these things while you are young and enthusiastic--even if\n",
      "you happened to make your money in some field outside them all.” You see, I have let\n",
      "my imagination run away with me--I already saw you aloft on a gold\n",
      "pedestal. Christina embarrassed him by a farewell embrace and\n",
      "a tear, while promising him a monthly box of good things. In spite of remonstrance he\n",
      "also packed his axe. The necessary autumn and winter wardrobe he bought for his charge\n",
      "called forth a vigorous remonstrance; Fessenden had never imagined\n",
      "such reckless extravagance; but when his mentor had reassured him,\n",
      "he further indulged himself in several sweaters. I should like it myself, but I\n",
      "dare not linger in New York an hour--its air is fatal to me--so near\n",
      "the Atlantic--you will see enough of New York in the future--I am sure\n",
      "you will not mind.” Morris suspected the cause and\n",
      "turned pale with anxiety. Fessenden’s face, however,\n",
      "was flushed, his eyes were as bright as tears. he exclaimed, with a complete disregard of the\n",
      "bystanders that was quite superb. “ It is doubtful if\n",
      "he is in New York, and he is not the man to do anything so silly and\n",
      "sentimental. That is to say, a\n",
      "combination of all this very modern university can teach you. Fortunately his deep emotions\n",
      "always rendered him speechless, and Morris was permitted to sleep\n",
      "peacefully during the greater part of the journey. He longed for real solitude,\n",
      "feeling for the first time the miserable substitute the crowd offers;\n",
      "and suddenly understood how much closer to the great realities of life\n",
      "it brings a man than any actual juxtaposition. His imagination idealized and\n",
      "personified the engine he worked upon as it had his canoe; and on the\n",
      "day when he finally mastered the difficult art of taking it to pieces\n",
      "and putting it together again without help or hitch, he challenged the\n",
      "strong man of the college to combat, and polished him off with such\n",
      "enthusiasm that once more he occupied the proud position of champion. The military drill did not give him enough exercise, and he had\n",
      "promised his father he would waste no time on sport. “ He brought it forth, fingered it lovingly\n",
      "in a rush of memories, then shouldered it and started for the open\n",
      "country. The military drill not only dismissed his mountain slouch and gave him\n",
      "a free and upright carriage, but inspired him with dreams of war and\n",
      "glory. It was not long before he became\n",
      "restless in the ranks and announced to the West Point officer in\n",
      "charge his desire to become captain. That the red hair of a daughter of the\n",
      "Cæsars would one day entangle itself in his wondrous electrical stores,\n",
      "and jerk them far afield, he did not forebode then, poor Fessenden; he\n",
      "was happy in his dreams and ideals. Five hundred dollars a year are a good\n",
      "  deal, and you are younger than I am, remember. Perhaps you may imagine what\n",
      "  it means to me to reflect that I have such a son to lean on in my\n",
      "  old age! The summer was pleasant and\n",
      "profitable for all, but particularly for Fessenden, who found many\n",
      "hours to dream alone among his mountains and into the sympathetic ear\n",
      "of _Pocahontas_. In answer, Mr. Abbott invariably reminded him that as yet he knew\n",
      "nothing of the rich, and advised him to suspend judgment. But his fellow-men interested Fessenden less at this period than the\n",
      "wonderful excursions he was making daily into the new realms of thought\n",
      "and research. He sustained the balance by looking worse than usual\n",
      "during the week. The bequest was accompanied by the condition that during the ensuing\n",
      "year certain eminent authorities were to be asked to lecture. Fessenden listened with\n",
      "tingling nerves and legs moving restlessly. He had in his imagination a union of steel and electricity so\n",
      "madly romantic that he dared not confide even in his father. Thank God that will be almost\n",
      "  immediately. May I ask you not to arrive\n",
      "  in a sweater? It also occurred to him with startling\n",
      "abruptness that he had never seen his father’s signature. It isn’t only curiosity that prompts me to ask for your secret--there\n",
      "is no necessity for maunderings on my part. He was feeling his strength at every\n",
      "nerve-point, he knew himself to be ready to go out and conquer the\n",
      "world at once; his mind had flashed back during the exciting day to the\n",
      "long course of training, from his babyhood until this last week of his\n",
      "twenty-first year, which had modelled his inherited forces in brain\n",
      "and character, slowly and safely, given him the physical endurance to\n",
      "keep pace with the restless energies of his mind. I should have to\n",
      "tell you so much--and my ambitions are defined and at the same time\n",
      "rather nebulous. I don’t know, myself--but--and you’re the\n",
      "only person living I’d say this to, and I’d break even your head if you\n",
      "gave a hint before he was ready--I think he is a great inventor and\n",
      "wanted me to have this training that I might help him.” “I have not seen him for years, but not through lack of affection--he\n",
      "asked me to trust him and I have done so. He held Mr. Abbott’s last letter to the lamp and read it aloud; then\n",
      "plunged his hands into his pockets, planted himself squarely on his\n",
      "feet, and told Keene of his peculiar relations with his father since\n",
      "his mother’s death. Even when I was a little chap\n",
      "and he used to pet and fondle me, I could feel the power come out of\n",
      "him, and I told Morris once that if he wasn’t a rich man it must be his\n",
      "own fault--he made you feel he could be anything he chose. The next day, as the two men parted at Chicago, Keene, who was far\n",
      "more mature than Fessenden, having less of the eternal boy in him,\n",
      "put his arm about his friend’s shoulder and said hesitatingly:\n",
      "“Remember--there are terrible disappointments awaiting you out here in\n",
      "the great world--as for all of us. When his eyes were not hard or dreamy with\n",
      "concentrated thought they were ready to laugh their response into any\n",
      "friendly eyes they chanced to meet. When he had forced his way\n",
      "beyond the barriers, he nearly crushed Mr. Abbott’s firm bony hand,\n",
      "then pulled it through his arm and--started for Forty-second Street. Fessenden wondered, but\n",
      "assumed that his father lived in a private hotel. It was a great room, lifted bodily from a ducal\n",
      "castle--books, pictures, busts, weapons--in the devouring American\n",
      "fashion. His\n",
      "face was more sallow than usual, but his glance was unwavering. “ Again Fessenden was inarticulate, and under this merciless assault even\n",
      "his anger fell. He stared at his father with paling eyes and coloring\n",
      "face. Fessenden, bewildered with the knowledge that he stood on the threshold\n",
      "of an unknown world which even now mocked his years of strenuous\n",
      "endeavor, resumed his chair mechanically and fixed his eyes on his\n",
      "father’s face that he might make sure he was hearing facts at least. It was a matter\n",
      "of indifference to me how much money she spent so long as she was\n",
      "contented--she was badly spoiled--and as she was a beautiful and clever\n",
      "creature I was very proud of her; moreover, too busy to regret that she\n",
      "had so little time for me. There was every prospect that\n",

      "son. I had known the Nettlebecks for many years; I\n",

      "from their farm. Only Fritz, who acted as our guide, knew that I was a\n",
      "rich man, and I knew his capacity for silence. I did not wait to communicate with Nettlebeck. So far, I have given you only my\n",

      "and, as it proved, childless Jewess of Budapest, gave her a unique\n",
      "and impregnable position which made her the most natural guardian in\n",
      "Austria for a young princess who had left her father’s roof to hold\n",
      "court in his most conspicuous possession. Her reputation as a dragoness relieved him of much of the\n",
      "anxiety with which he had entered upon this radical experiment, and he\n",
      "had not chanced to take note of her mellowing. She had come to Buda in full\n",
      "possession of his confidence. Now that Rudolf was dead, she cared more for Ranata and Alexandra than\n",
      "for any one in the world, and was determined, to use the phrase of her\n",
      "American protégée, that they should have the “time of their lives.” Zrinyi was leaning against one of the pillars, his black eyes flaming\n",
      "down upon Alexandra, who smiled upon him indulgently; she thought him\n",
      "a nice boy who might be useful in the cotillion and in general advice\n",
      "of a lighter nature. They were all discussing the momentous question of\n",
      "the first entertainment to be given by the new court. “You may need help,” he murmured, and he looked at Ranata. “That will be your second stroke of diplomacy,” murmured Alexandra. “But it seems to me that I should be a screaming absurdity in an\n",
      "ancient Hungarian costume.” Impoverished, and knowing little of the world beyond\n",
      "Budapest, the present generation was even fiercer in pride than the\n",
      "majority of their order, and bitterer in their hatred of the Hapsburgs. Outwardly the Countess was\n",
      "irreproachable. She was lively and cultivated, and there was nothing in her manner to\n",
      "betray her hostility. Of the\n",
      "most ancient blood in Hungary, poor, high-spirited, and proud, she had\n",
      "seen nothing of the world, but her high accomplishments and qualities,\n",
      "and the affection which she had inspired in the Queen while a child,\n",
      "had induced Sarolta to select her for what the cynical elder believed\n",
      "to be a temporary post. The Archduchess understood her perfectly, but she felt her own\n",
      "strength, and was amused at the flash in the American’s eyes. He was a mighty figure, that son of John Hunyadi, and I have not the\n",
      "slightest doubt that the blood of kings was in his veins. Have you\n",
      "ever seen the peasants dance it? And I believe it is\n",
      "the right thing to do. And the great Alfold had long since suggested to the practical mind of\n",
      "Fessenden what could be done with the Western deserts; in the last five\n",
      "years he had reclaimed the largest of them by means of a complicated\n",
      "system of irrigation, and encouragement of immigration from the Eastern\n",
      "States. But he had accomplished a great deal, and he was only thirty-one. Most men would have said that he had fame and power enough to satisfy\n",
      "any man of his years. His accomplishment in South America alone had\n",
      "made his name a byword on two hemispheres. With the more advanced states it was a mere question of capital,\n",
      "particularly as the enterprise was a private one, and sure to bring an\n",
      "increase of civilization and wealth. To-day the\n",
      "trains had increased ten per cent., Four hundred\n",
      "thousand negroes had emigrated, and, reverting easily to a state of\n",
      "amiable and naked barbarism--sinking to the bottom as naturally as the\n",
      "black mud of the Mississippi--worked in the fields for the white man\n",
      "and forgot the Constitution of the United States. All these men were among Fessenden’s bitterest and\n",
      "most enterprising foes. More than once Fessenden’s faith had been shaken, and even with the\n",
      "vast resources at his disposal he had hesitated before the increasing\n",
      "costliness of his coy ideal; but he dreaded the possibly demoralizing\n",
      "effect of his first failure; the position in which he could place\n",
      "the United States lured him on; and his father believed in the idea\n",
      "and encouraged him to persist. At the last possible moment he hastened home\n",
      "and raised one of the most satisfactory regiments that went to Cuba. But his smile was still quick and delightful,\n",
      "and his eyes, if sharper, were as bright and dark, sometimes as happy\n",
      "and eager as ever. Indeed there was a great deal; and as he rode straight towards the\n",
      "gala village on Count Zrinyi’s estate, he was in a very susceptible\n",
      "not to say sentimental frame of mind--which was usually the case when\n",
      "he was alone in Europe. He had worked it deeply in the way of adventure and the\n",
      "realizing of patriotic ideals, superficially when he met an attractive\n",
      "woman. But life had pressed him too hard for love; moreover, he was\n",
      "easily disillusioned, and this particular ideal increased in stature\n",
      "and seemed ever more impossible of attainment. He stood on a lonely\n",
      "height himself, and he wanted a woman who stood on one as lonely. So he had seen the Archduchess!--was about to meet her at last! His deep, almost\n",
      "passionate love of adventure shook him slightly from head to foot. We made Zrinyi borrow clothes from two of his servants--and here\n",
      "we are. Of course you’ll\n",
      "fall in love with her--I’ve seen it coming for years; but don’t propose\n",
      "on the spot and spoil all our fun.” “Alas, that your first word should be so cruel! His brothers drew the\n",
      "first long wail from their fiddles. “Ah, you dream of a universal democracy, I suppose. They were the tallest couple in the\n",
      "room, and those who sat had much to say in comment. There was little\n",
      "to criticise, for their natural grace and beauty of form diverted\n",
      "the eye from their few mistakes; and in truth those whose blood is\n",
      "quick must learn the Chardash easily. It is the story of elementary passion before man was\n",
      "created to express it,” Ranata had said to Alexandra before they had\n",
      "ventured to take part; and certainly the Hungarian peasant, intelligent\n",
      "and gay, but polite and dignified to his marrow, is worthy of a place\n",
      "beside the impersonal artists of any civilization. He had been Alexandra’s favorite theme from childhood, and Ranata’s\n",
      "interest had never flagged. He had\n",
      "seemed to her the most splendid and picturesque of living creatures,\n",
      "and although the reduction of Alexandra’s allowance for a year to\n",
      "the wages of a footman by her perturbed father had cured her of the\n",
      "habit of exaggeration, she still could tell a pretty tale, and there\n",
      "had been much to recount during Fessenden’s sojourn in South America\n",
      "and after his return. I might have known it\n",
      "would bring me bad luck!” She had been taken abominable\n",
      "advantage of. That royalty, or aristocracy for\n",
      "that matter, moves on unselfconscious heights is one of the fictions\n",
      "of fiction. The aristocracies of Europe may not, in the manner of\n",
      "the American, carry their ancestors like a bunch of chips on their\n",
      "shoulder, but like royalty, they are “simple and unaffected” only so\n",
      "long as they are not expected to be humble and are not approached by\n",
      "the wrong sort of people. A mist rose to\n",
      "and diffused itself through the historic tiers of Ranata’s brain, and\n",
      "created an illusion. She was primeval woman\n",
      "dancing with primeval man. Fessenden, who was too hot and thirsty to be sentimental, much less\n",
      "conscious of outraged royalty that he had been swinging in the\n",
      "Chardash, glanced about longingly. “ If you will wait here I’ll fetch you some.” As he walked away, his white blouse and skirts flapping in the breeze,\n",
      "Ranata sank upon a bench. And I must\n",
      "confess at once that I knew he was here, and might have warned you. On the rough side of the cliff,\n",
      "far below the citadel, was a mass of lights like a meteor fallen upon\n",
      "a void, so dark were the woods and rocks about the little kiosk where\n",
      "men and women drank their iced coffee to the music of the gypsies. The twentieth century is not the eighteenth nor yet the\n",
      "nineteenth. There will be an American queen in Europe\n",
      "yet. But he was not possessing his soul in patience. If she choose to dress\n",
      "herself as a peasant and dance with peasants, what right had she to\n",
      "vent her anger upon him for dancing with her as respectfully as the\n",
      "most courteous among them? He had chosen to ignore her state, and no\n",
      "course could have been more consistent. By which it will be seen that there were many things Fessenden\n",
      "knew better than woman. Whether he was in love with the Archduchess of Austria or not he\n",
      "was at no pains to discover. There were guards everywhere, and it looked as\n",
      "impregnable as a fortress. There would be no hair-breadth rescue from that\n",
      "palace, unless, indeed, of himself. I see\n",
      "your new rôle is to lack nothing in thoroughness. Have you made up your\n",
      "mind how the Chardash is to be danced?” When Ranata chose to be unfathomable there was an aloofness about her\n",
      "which suggested that her soul was surrounded by the watchful ghosts of\n",
      "all her ancestors. “Will you write, or shall Sarolta send him a formal invitation?” Even when I was a child he often\n",
      "came and spent an hour with me, partly out of pity for my loneliness,\n",
      "partly because I was so much like himself in many ways, and in despair\n",
      "that I could not join in all his sports. The blood was in her cheeks, and her eyes were\n",
      "flashing with a curious angry animation. She also experienced a sensation of terror which vibrated oddly among\n",
      "her calm and calculating particles. Should she write and tell Fessenden\n",
      "to go at once? But should she send\n",
      "away Fessenden and leave Ranata at peace with her dead and her duties? Passion, suffering, tragedy--she had given them no thought,\n",
      "well as she knew Ranata’s capacity for all. He usually teased her and\n",
      "joked with her; but his serious side and his achievement had no more\n",
      "fervent admirer. We were talking about visiting\n",
      "your count,” she said. “ I am sure you want to go, and it will give\n",
      "me the opportunity to make the progress I intended through some of\n",
      "the villages. And tell him of all our plans\n",
      "and schemes. I must find out before I sleep to-night.” Ranata, to those who knew her well, had never looked so beautiful. Those\n",
      "within her range had no sense whatever of being entertained by royalty;\n",
      "forgot the awful dinners they had sat through with their king; were\n",
      "at exactly the same informal ease as when dining with each other. Her ardent nature struggled with its\n",
      "bonds. She felt a momentary impulse to tell them that she was happy for\n",
      "the first time in her life, and felt as keenly as they the common bond\n",
      "of human nature. “It is a very great scheme, and I am entirely at your disposal. Surely you are powerful\n",
      "enough to set your own fashions.” If I opened the gates, where would be the end? “It would be a great victory gained if you could bring the members of\n",
      "the Extreme Left to court. “Do you think I have given no thought to the Kossuths? Bring them here--house them\n",
      "in the servants’ quarters for two or three nights. Do not offer to pay\n",
      "anything but their expenses. Give them a\n",
      "feast and dance of their own afterwards. All the peasantry of Hungary\n",
      "will be delighted. Let your other guests dance the Chardash in their\n",
      "own way afterwards. One would think this was the first that ever had been heard of. She lifted her head and said defiantly, “I shall not dance at\n",
      "all.” Do you expect me to be eternally on\n",
      "my guard lest I make a reference to it?” Her anger had ebbed in an unaccountable\n",
      "manner. Many changes had lifted their heads within her since her break\n",
      "for comparative independence and her rapid victory. The retrospect\n",
      "had filled her with an alternate fury and delight. Woman-like she had\n",
      "vented her wrath on the man; and he had commanded her waking thoughts\n",
      "to the exclusion of the Austrian dynasty. Then, with the elaborate\n",
      "subtlety of the feminine mind, she had persuaded herself that her\n",
      "duty to her country demanded that she win the American from the man\n",
      "who menaced the future integrity of the Austrian Empire; and, buoyed\n",
      "up by the virtue of her cause, she had drawn him into the circle of\n",
      "her influence, having first analyzed him into the abstract condition\n",
      "of a curiosity. But an interview with a Königsegg was\n",
      "a simple matter beside playing with fire when the fire was actually\n",
      "between one’s fingers; the hereditary game of coquetry was no guide. Even listening to Alexandra,\n",
      "I have held my breath. Ranata has a very particular reason for turning my\n",
      "brother’s head. I promised, in a moment of enthusiasm, to help her. I want Ranata\n",
      "to succeed in all that she has undertaken, but I do not want my brother\n",
      "sacrificed.” It\n",
      "is one of the amusing reminiscences of age. When you have learned, my\n",
      "child, how much they can stand--_enfin!_ She would suffer quite horribly, because she must be\n",
      "utterly without hope; even intrigue would be forbidden her--she has too\n",
      "much at stake. She had discussed this plan\n",
      "with her mentor, and it had been agreed upon as a last resort. The enthusiasm and curiosity she excited among the masses were\n",
      "sufficient to satisfy the most patriotic and feminine heart. Every day\n",
      "from four to five she drove abroad, taking invariably the same route;\n",
      "crossing the suspension-bridge and driving out the wide Andrássy _ut_\n",
      "into the Stefenia _ut_ of the park. Beloved as her father was in Vienna, his people\n",
      "showed him no further attention in public than a perfunctory salute;\n",
      "and although in Hungary the masses cheered him during his brief visits,\n",
      "it was much in the same manner as the American is enthusiastic over\n",
      "any spectacle that varies the monotony of business. When she left it she was mobbed into her carriage by a throng\n",
      "that impeded the traffic. The\n",
      "constant interruptions from the Extreme Left in nowise disturbed it. “Well, you see, success in a great war would bind all parties in a\n",
      "common approval.” Fessenden was not to be nonplussed by methods direct or indirect. “And this story I heard yesterday--that he is having his second son\n",
      "taught Hungarian--is that true?” Ranata lifted her eyes to his; they were both soft and dazzling. “ If we are ever\n",
      "alone for a moment I will tell you why.” He had won again\n",
      "and with her own weapons. Tumultuous delight, amazement, anger, rushed\n",
      "through her brain. “What you learn of the national temperament will be from me, not from\n",
      "my sister.” Surely, your enormous interests in\n",
      "America--they must demand your attention before long.” Would you stay here if your great\n",
      "fortune were in danger--if--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should stay here if the world went to smash.” Her eyes wandered several times to the benches of the Extreme Left. There was one who overtopped\n",
      "his fellows by a head. This head was shaped like a cannon-ball and\n",
      "surrounded by harsh black hair. His eye sought that of the Obersthofmeisterin. Wholly unused to the effort to please, she would have\n",
      "enjoyed this new exercise of power with all that was feminine in her\n",
      "nature, had the dynasty been rooted in the fires of the earth. He was ardent and susceptible,\n",
      "and for the moment he was not in love. If Ranata had looked like most princesses doubtless he\n",
      "would have held sternly to his ideals. He made a final grasp for his politics\n",
      "and his pride. Your Royal-- Yes, of course\n",
      "you should understand our politics--would to Heaven that you did!” We can arrange then for an hour\n",
      "when you are not too busy to talk to us.” “I cannot go to your ball, your Royal Highness--none of the Left will\n",
      "go.” “But my ball has nothing to do with politics. Remember that you are\n",
      "far more your own master than I am mistress of my acts.” It was twinkling with appreciation of a fellow-man’s\n",
      "enslavement. But it is success or failure, and I shall not fail.” “Your tactics are those of the man who wins. It was a very beautiful room now, with its\n",
      "golden walls, its rich Oriental hangings and chairs. To-day neither was sensible of pleasantries. Her subtle brain cleared and balanced its\n",
      "parts. If he were any one else’s\n",
      "brother I should follow your course with pleasure--I was as delighted\n",
      "as amused at your easy subjugation of poor Molnár this morning; for\n",
      "I am, up to a certain point, heart and soul with you in this great\n",
      "matter--but Fessenden is my brother.” Can you look at this matter dispassionately and\n",
      "impersonally, Alexandra? “I have no desire to make a fool of him.” If you\n",
      "cannot love my brother send him away.” We need not go over that old ground again. And if William\n",
      "conquered Russia--” she waved her hands expressively. Besides, the Slavs outside of Russia have little desire\n",
      "to put themselves under the heel of the heaviest tyranny in Europe. I never raise my eyes to the heavens at\n",
      "night that I do not fancy I see his star laughing at me. There is no sufficient reason why\n",
      "it should not happen again. “I have seen enough to know that he is a man who would give the one\n",
      "woman the world if she asked for it. She had hardly\n",
      "expected such frankness, well as she knew the methods of diplomacy. In a moment, however, her practical brain replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe Fessenden is very sentimental. “Of course you have already begun to idealize him. William and Fessenden both know how to take care\n",
      "of themselves. Doubtless you have\n",
      "been called mad yourself. Profoundly imbued, according to them, with the doctrine that a\n",
      "man should develop his personality at the expense of every duty, every\n",
      "affection, of kin or subject, she withdrew herself more and more, not\n",
      "only from the world, but from her husband and children, that she might\n",
      "devote her thoughts only to what was beautiful, live the inner life\n",
      "alone, and develop her personality in a manner possible to most people\n",
      "only after they have cast off the flesh; that her sensitiveness in time\n",
      "became so great that contact with common mortals was unbearable. Nature\n",
      "never intended her to mount a throne. Instead of that the poor\n",
      "child was suddenly shot from her simple country home, where hardly\n",
      "a whisper of the world and its ways had reached her, up to the most\n",
      "formal and exacting throne in Europe. First, while she was very\n",
      "young, she ran away and sulked for several years. Every person of refined tastes cares less and\n",
      "less for the world as he grows older. “As to Ludvig--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A moment,” interrupted Fessenden, “what of Rudolf?” He undoubtedly killed himself in a wild moment of\n",
      "intolerable _ennui_ and disgust. If you will look at his photographs, even those taken after he became\n",
      "gross and had suffered from many attacks of insanity, you will see\n",
      "that his eyes were always the eyes of the idealist. It was to this\n",
      "very idealism that he owed his insanity. Above all others was the\n",
      "monastic ideal of chastity, but he did not have the self-denial to live\n",
      "on monastic fare; and he was a king, and there was everything in his\n",
      "life to give his brain and imagination a preternatural activity. The lovely face of Elizabeth, with its\n",
      "strange and disconcerting shadow of perpetual girlhood, looked from\n",
      "several of the bits of porcelain and ivory. There were two of Ranata\n",
      "herself, one in haughty profile, the other with eyes cast down, but,\n",
      "by cunning art, suggesting a swift uplifting of lash and a blaze\n",
      "beneath. Fessenden studied it for a moment\n",
      "in silence, then turned and looked at her sharply. She colored\n",
      "slightly and turned her head away. Its movement happened to be in the\n",
      "direction of the door leading into the sitting-room. That may happen at any moment, for all our history\n",
      "has proved that you can try an American so far and no farther. I ‘found myself’ earlier than most men\n",
      "do, and I have been finishing my education ever since. My final accomplishment, of course, depends\n",
      "entirely upon circumstances. My best effort now is to make myself ready\n",
      "to meet any contingency whatever, and to leap swiftly to its mastery.” Do you think so meanly of my resources as that?” Ranata had let her arm drop to her side; her hand was not an inch from\n",
      "Fessenden’s. I must turn you out directly; it is nearly time to dress.” Fessenden marched to the chair, and rocked himself for twenty minutes\n",
      "with every appearance of content. The peasants had come and were housed, and a\n",
      "remarkable band of gypsies had been found in Transylvania. He established and personally disciplined a body\n",
      "of foot soldiers--the Black Troop--modelled upon and equal to the\n",
      "famous Janissaries of Turkey, conquered the Czechs, and captured\n",
      "Vienna, driving out Frederick, the German Emperor, forcing him to take\n",
      "refuge in a wagon drawn by oxen, and to beg from convent to monastery\n",
      "like any common mendicant. The books, collected by Matthias, and in\n",
      "many cases written for him, numbered ten thousand. It is a\n",
      "small yet impressive sum to stake as an expression of our confidence in\n",
      "ourselves and our Hungarian subjects.” The women as well as the men were in the eccentric splendor of\n",
      "their national dress, and although it varied little in cut, fancy and\n",
      "extravagance prevailed in the materials of the low bodice, the apron,\n",
      "and the voluminous skirts; and bodice, neck, and arms were almost\n",
      "obliterated by the big dull uncut jewels and heavy chains which, with\n",
      "the ancient costumes of velvet and satin, embroidered and brocaded with\n",
      "a lost art, neither time nor poverty has been able to drive from the\n",
      "chest of the Hungarian. In the high gallery\n",
      "that traverses the hall a military band played softly. Their presence was a surprise to all, and they had\n",
      "inspired almost as much conversation as the royal hostess herself. Zrinyi, if he did not yet understand her, was by this time sufficiently\n",
      "seasoned to accept her sallies with neither sulks nor despair. I feel that to-night she will either make\n",
      "a--a--portentous impression or disillusionize us altogether.” “Only this morning in the park, where I happened to be rather early. “Think of the reserve force, lacking in your emotional woman! At least I don’t delude myself that you are a poet in\n",
      "disguise. Well, I only ask that you marry me and let me begin your\n",
      "education. The staff of the Grand Chamberlain smote the\n",
      "floor three times. Her appearance and her solitary progress between the ranks of bowing\n",
      "pages in their rich mediæval costumes, was as startling in its historic\n",
      "naturalness as in its stately and picturesque beauty. and in\n",
      "another moment the vast company, from Prince Illehazy, most dignified\n",
      "of magnates, to the most truculent deputy in the room, were stamping\n",
      "their feet and shouting “_Élyen!_” He wore a fierce red uniform, and\n",
      "stood against the wall with his arms folded. Ranata smiled brilliantly, and motioned to him to come forth. He obeyed\n",
      "with such precipitation that there was a momentary panic in the ranks. The others were obdurate, but I shall win\n",
      "another time. He looked far more the king than her father or any other sovereign in\n",
      "Europe, except perhaps the man whose memory she had expunged to-night. When they fail it is due to bungling only.” Furthermore, if I won I was to pay\n",
      "the price of the costume three times over and return it to him the day\n",
      "after the ball. “Your horrible money may have bought poor old Nadasdy, but it will\n",
      "carry you no further.” Ranata was aghast, but it was impossible to struggle, and she\n",
      "stood rigid, but closer to him by two inches. It was by no means the first time the temptation had beset her since\n",
      "she had met Fessenden Abbott, but her brain had controlled her\n",
      "hitherto; she had fancied that her clear vision would keep the end\n",
      "always in view, however she might feel the weakness of woman within her\n",
      "and indulge it in friendship, while working for the cause of her house. And before her was the great\n",

      "the fullest equipment granted to mortals, but the development of her\n",
      "own individuality in its incorruptible silences must go on forever,\n",
      "submerged only by the primal tides; and so her instincts and her\n",
      "endowment saved her from the pursuit of that will-o’-the-wisp which\n",
      "most women follow until it hides in the grave. She saw that Fessenden\n",
      "recognized in her this disunion of temperament and personality, for\n",
      "although his were the masculine limitations which deprived him of the\n",
      "comprehensions women think they want, the needs of his own soul were\n",
      "too great for blindness to another that had come so close. She reminded herself that this may have been the\n",
      "result of their daily conversations, his abrupt confidential asides;\n",
      "and believed she might assure herself that when the spell was removed\n",
      "her interest in subjects so foreign to all in her previous twenty-eight\n",
      "years would vanish with the sweetness of life. Her jealousy was purely impersonal,\n",
      "and induced no alteration in her attitude towards Alexandra. She took for granted that he loved\n",
      "his sister--would have thought him deficient in human nature if he had\n",
      "not. The mummy was Sarolta, who was\n",
      "in bed with a cold. Of the compact, of course, she\n",
      "knew nothing; and had she, still would she have puzzled, knowing the\n",
      "power and the will of woman to torment herself; but she had come to the\n",

      "alone--this the good lady also believed--did not wholly realize her\n",

      "could in the way of preliminary disenchantment. Nature invariably compensates, and in exchanging wisdom\n",
      "for youth she is at her best. When they are, they are not able to hurt us, so may be left\n",
      "out of the question. But the average man, so particular with\n",
      "charm at first, merely lets us down in _ennui_. Shortly after, he becomes as matter-of-fact as he is. And then men\n",
      "are, no matter what their brains, utterly, irretrievably stupid where\n",
      "women are concerned. You will always be more or less\n",
      "guided by it. Therefore, you are worth the trouble to warn.” I believe that the only way a woman can avoid the cut of her sex\n",
      "is to avoid the fulfilment of love. I don’t know but\n",
      "that would be the deepest definition of heaven after all.” That would be Nature and\n",
      "her compensations as we know them. Zrinyi, Prince Illehazy, Vilma, and Alexandra had gone\n",
      "for a walk, and Piroska had not been seen that day. Alexandra had announced herself satisfied with the castle;\n",
      "but as her tone had been frivolous, Zrinyi had forborne to press his\n",
      "suit. The\n",
      "staircase, towards which Fessenden directed eyes of impatient longing,\n",
      "looked as if no woman had ever descended it, although many women had\n",
      "huddled there when the Turkish guns were battering. Fessenden thought\n",
      "it an admirable setting for a honeymoon; failing that, for a few days’\n",
      "final courtship. Never again, he\n",
      "had determined long since, would he go through that futile agony at the\n",
      "instance of anything less than death; when he found the one woman whom\n",
      "he could love more than his life or his ambitions--or as well--then\n",
      "would he pour all he had husbanded at her feet; but he would have her\n",
      "unless the Almighty himself intervened. Sarolta is in bed, and Piroska has a\n",
      "toothache; but who knows?” That is usually one of the duties of the Obersthofmeisterin. I doubt if she has made any report of\n",
      "consequence so far, for she has bided her time, hoping that the worst\n",
      "would happen; but she will, for she wants to marry you. She spoke in a tone of profound dejection. In a moment she withdrew from his embrace and leaned against the\n",
      "window-frame and stared down into the ravine where so many Turks had\n",
      "mouldered to dust. The two months you set yourself\n",
      "have nearly passed. You owe me your confidence--nor is there any one\n",
      "else to whom you would give it.” To no other have I ever been\n",
      "as--been frank at all. And I have that sense of the indestructible bond. Will it content you--that sense of spiritual\n",
      "completeness--can you be faithful to that?” Nothing in me protested, warned, except a mechanical effort\n",
      "of intellect. I\n",
      "thought when I entered into that compact that I should lead a dual\n",
      "mental life; or rather that I should be wholly yours when with you,\n",
      "and wholly myself when alone, fully alive to the end. But I have been\n",
      "wholly yours when alone, and as wholly oblivious of the future. But I--I\n",
      "feel as if this secret revolution in me had made me capable of greater\n",
      "than weakness--that is common enough in my class! It has bred in me\n",
      "an indifference--there, I have said it!--to all that I have held most\n",
      "sacred. I feel as if I had slipped into another world. You will no more fall back\n",
      "into your old state of mediæval ignorance and superstition than I shall\n",
      "be wholly myself until I possess you. The imagination is quiescent while companioned--but\n",
      "wait!” Another man would make it inevitable, but you will not; and in a\n",
      "few days I shall be battling with regrets, and hating myself the more.” And it is necessary\n",
      "that I keep my head until I am able in all ways to protect you.” Her skin was bare of jewels, her hair piled high and\n",
      "without ornament. Her whole\n",
      "figure expressed vigor, energy, impatience ill-confined. She doubtless occupies a very considerable part of her time\n",
      "thinking out new gowns with which to distract us.” “No; but no man can wear a mask forever, unless he is secretly happier\n",
      "than he would have us believe.” So I have\n",
      "sent men about inviting them to come here to-night. They\n",
      "are born in sacrifice, and they die in it, having known little else. And your brother--it is his first\n",
      "disappointment? If Ranata and Fessenden suddenly made up their\n",
      "minds to run off, should you help them?” The Hapsburgs have done a good deal for love--but that!” “I have always wondered,” murmured Zrinyi, “why you did not put three\n",
      "heads on your eagle while you were about it.” “I have no objection to being an American if I can live in Europe. Besides,\n",
      "we have Piroska to do the spying. The King will not remain too long\n",
      "unwarned. But Ranata’s love-affair hardly worries me as much as this\n",
      "perhaps too sudden popularity. The rest became aware of a deep low murmur, not unlike the rolling in\n",
      "of tides. Zrinyi left the table hastily and looked from one of the\n",
      "narrow windows at the upper end of the hall. The full moon\n",
      "swung close to the ice-fields, the white harsh peaks high above. On their heads were high fur hats, which\n",
      "exposed but a fringe of long hair on their shoulders and concealed\n",
      "their brows, giving them an aspect of singular wildness. When they had finished, Zrinyi turned to Ranata. “ Ranata remained with the group until the incoming throng had almost\n",
      "filled the hall. The doors were still open, and behind the mass of\n",
      "heads on the platform she could see the snowy slopes of the range,\n",
      "whose silences seemed to have fallen upon the castle; no one spoke,\n",
      "and the sandals of the mountaineers pressed the floor silently. And I am honored and\n",
      "happy that you have come to see me.” Oh, those were the\n",
      "days, your Highness--first a prince, then a gypsy, then a prince, then\n",
      "a gypsy, all mixed up, all drunk, everybody happy. The man’s speech broke through the severity of her mood and she\n",
      "laughed. “ When Rudolf left us\n",
      "the last time I said he would not return. Nature has protected many by a mask\n",
      "as ugly as the plague. I have not superstition enough\n",
      "for that, but in the name of my brother I will send you a purse to the\n",
      "servants’ quarters to-night.” said Ranata; and this time the man mingled his featureless\n",
      "sheepskin with the others. She beckoned to Zrinyi and spoke with him a\n",
      "moment. And Ranata said in Roumanian, and with the cold accent of finality, “He\n",

      "Vienna, the stately brown city, so haughty without, so simple within. If Ranata had not been preoccupied\n",
      "she would have noticed the evident embarrassment in his manner and\n",
      "his elaborate attempt at dissimulation. The Emperor drew a long breath of relief. Nevertheless, he\n",
      "divined that her mind must be in heavy shadow to prompt an immediate\n",
      "act of devotion at some inconvenience, when any other time would have\n",
      "done as well. Trained in detail, he\n",
      "remembered that he had never seen her wear such a veil before. There was truth\n",
      "in the story that she loved the American; and she wished to do penance\n",
      "among the tombs of her ancestors. His instinct was to desert the sinking ship, but\n",
      "he found it difficult to connect Ranata with the idea of failure; she\n",
      "looked, pallid and extinguished as she was, cast for a great part--not\n",
      "endowed by Nature with the finest gifts of the Hapsburgs to languish\n",
      "in obscurity. However, the man selected was\n",
      "of Hapsburg blood; no vow of renunciation would be required of her,\n",
      "and at the right moment she could be summoned forth. She wondered if she would be frightened, and dismissed the thought\n",
      "with an impatient shrug. But it is merely the perversity of the brain. Like a spoiled child, it must do precisely what is not expected of it. The court-yard was deserted; and the scene was\n",
      "intolerably dreary. Suddenly she was seized with a wild unreasoning terror, an impulse to\n",
      "fly from the Hofburg to Budapest and her many friends. A premonition\n",
      "seemed to rise out of the dark and press close upon her. She was\n",
      "a practical soul, and it was likely. He had extinguished his taper and looked like a statue at\n",
      "prayer. Her eye rested again on the coffin of the Duc de Reichstadt. I feel,\n",
      "rather, as if my spirit had been purged down here, than packed with its\n",
      "old ghosts.” And there she faced\n",
      "and accepted the truth. She lifted her head suddenly with a sensation of liberty, of\n",
      "independence, which even Hungary and her intimate spiritual absorption\n",
      "of her American lover had not given her. The coachman slept profoundly on the box. If Fessenden were not already there a telegram would\n",
      "summon him in haste. From Berlin it was but a few hours to Bremen. She\n",
      "took another step forward, then almost laughed aloud. But if that had been\n",
      "futile, her brain and her sense of duty were still in control. To-morrow she would return to\n",
      "Hungary and take up her work there. XXXI\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She slept well, and late; then being already long past her early hour\n",
      "of rising, lay for a time, half in pleasure of that narrow world\n",
      "wherein she still could confuse dreams and life, half in dread of\n",
      "the realities into which she must step with her clothes. Should she\n",
      "stay in Vienna for a few days? The Hofburg had never seemed so dreary;\n",
      "her own rooms were musty and chill. She almost cried the words aloud\n",
      "as she sprang from her bed in a frantic desire to take some step--at\n",
      "once--before it was too late. It is all\n",
      "very well for the old and the wise to argue with the accents of fatigue\n",
      "that love is not the only thing in life; so it is not, for those that\n",
      "argue. Her father might\n",
      "require her submission before permitting her to return to Hungary. She felt as if the floor were swaying and\n",
      "sinking. Her eyes met his squarely in the manner he\n",
      "detested. The Emperor himself was looking remarkably well, in his parade uniform\n",
      "with its sky-blue coat and black and scarlet trousers. I am very sorry to seem to reprove you--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have expected it, of course. I have been warned from more sources than one. There is no doubt in my mind that Zrinyi made\n",
      "this opportunity for you, and he must take the consequences--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I doubt if he gave my private affairs a thought. Princes were born to earthly martyrdom tempered by much casual\n",
      "consolation. There was nothing for it but to plump out the name. Even were he\n",
      "willing to gain time by asserting that the man had not yet been chosen,\n",
      "he knew that she would detect the lie and place him at an immediate\n",
      "disadvantage. In a moment the blood rose hotly to her hair, even her eyes\n",
      "looked bloodshot. “ There was no better mettle in Europe than his. “I have not had a doubt of your resistance. I have as little of my\n",
      "firmness of purpose. You have not been sufficiently disciplined. “You will remain a prisoner in these rooms until you consent. Am I more helpless\n",
      "in the eyes of the law than the meanest of your subjects? If you are no longer my father but my tyrant, then from\n",
      "this moment I am your most rebellious subject and nothing more. If I had it in my power to do, I would give liberty and the\n",
      "broadest sort of constitutional government to every man that breathes. I am mortified that it took the deprivation of my own liberty to force\n",
      "my brain to acknowledge the truth. But to expect the godlike of one of us of royal blood is\n",
      "beyond reason, and I am thankful that I am not too dense to receive\n",
      "illumination from any source. I hope to God I\n",
      "may live to see every monarch now alive a useful member of a republic\n",
      "and no man degraded by being forced to submit to what he had no hand\n",
      "in making. He was purple, and his heavy underlip trembled. It was not the first, poor dear man, but I\n",
      "doubt if he ever had it quite so straight; for Ranata’s brain would\n",
      "always preserve her from the usual feminine tangents. He will keep\n",
      "his word, the more rigorously as he now no doubt thinks she is mad. But\n",
      "the situation is not humorous; it is tragic! They’ll\n",
      "never marry her, with or without antediluvian methods. Surely the Emperor will let her exercise in the\n",
      "riding-school. “I am sure the Emperor will not hear of it. The official announcement\n",
      "has been made that she is suffering from a light attack of\n",
      "influenza--light, you will understand, that neither suspicion nor too\n",
      "much sympathy may be awakened. If she went as far as the riding-school\n",
      "there would be too many people in the secret. If he doesn’t he may look upon his life as a\n",
      "failure. It might create a scandal and do\n",
      "the Princess a lasting injury. I think it would be better to leave the matter to Time.” They did jump, with the exception of Vilma. You are dumfounded because you know Europe only. “I have never been in the United States, but I think this strange\n",
      "love-affair is the most beautiful thing in the world, and I would help\n",
      "them if I could!” You do not believe, do you, that\n",
      "she would make such a marriage?” Sarolta, whose heart, as the astute Vilma well knew, was aching,\n",
      "appeared to consider deeply. I\n",
      "cannot see what you could accomplish; but you might let her see you\n",
      "occasionally in the Franzensplatz and give her a little comfort. He is shrewd enough to know this--or his ministers are. XXXIII\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For twenty-four hours Ranata’s brain whirled to no machinery but\n",
      "her wrath. To assume the disguise of a\n",
      "servant was equally impracticable, for not one of those in attendance\n",
      "upon her reached her shoulder, and they were as closely watched as\n",
      "herself. Ranata seldom\n",
      "sat down, but moved about until all her body ached with weariness,\n",
      "pausing every few moments to look down upon the Franzensplatz, through\n",
      "the sheltering lace of the curtain, in the hope that Fessenden Abbott\n",
      "would saunter through with intent to give her courage. If she tried to\n",
      "forget her plight in a book she would fling it down presently and fly\n",
      "to the window lest she miss him. The days passed and the lover gave no sign that he was as distraught\n",
      "as the prisoner. There are times in life when one lives very fast. He would marry,\n",
      "of course, and forget her; why, indeed, should he not? After all, it is the psychical\n",
      "experience that tells, not the visible cause, and the scars may be\n",
      "deep and callous. Time cured this mood; but the passing of doubt and the restoration of\n",
      "the lover to favor helped her little to serenity. She recalled every\n",
      "look, the tones of his voice, every moment they had snatched together,\n",
      "all that he had taught her. She slept\n",
      "but a few hours at night, waking with a load of despair and terror\n",
      "in her brain. It would not take\n",
      "him long to come back, you know; and then you have not given your\n",
      "formal consent to marriage with Aloys.” Suddenly her brows met, and she drew closer to the\n",
      "window. She even sighed, and let her\n",
      "mouth fall with discontent. When Vilma was directly beneath the window Ranata threw it open\n",
      "and leaned out. Ranata sat down to await the consequences of her act. She knew now that Fessenden had made his plans\n",
      "and that he would not fail. “That, I deeply regret to say, I am not permitted to tell you until we\n",
      "are in the train. “Oh, you will not have to go to sea with me; and you will be rid of me\n",
      "sooner than you think.” “Did my father order Mr. Abbott’s yacht to leave Trieste?” And Maria Leopoldina had the profound satisfaction of writing to her\n",
      "sovereign and cousin that evening that his daughter had received this\n",
      "proof of American absurdity and presumption with a peal of laughter\n",
      "which had warmed her own heart, heavy with responsibility, and with\n",
      "sympathy for his most gracious majesty. The Emperors, erect in their\n",
      "uniforms, were imposing figures. But he was old, and with the selfishness of the old had long\n",
      "since resolved that he would close his reign in peace could it be\n",
      "done without dishonor. And I am\n",
      "also convinced that it is our great and only chance. This\n",
      "great power is not given to him in the interest of his inheritance\n",
      "alone, although no doubt its welfare is his first duty, but as a\n",
      "stepping-stone to a greater power which shall benefit the human race. The old Emperor darted a glance at his rival and friend, as though to\n",
      "note if his tongue were in his cheek. And that it is the greatest destiny\n",
      "that ever has befallen any sovereign. Far from\n",
      "fearing such increase of power, of responsibility, I court it, I am\n",
      "eager for it, for with no lesser weapons can I accomplish the destiny\n",
      "to which I was born.” Fessenden, thrilling, forgot his own\n",
      "desires for the moment: he knew that however the Emperor might feel\n",
      "to-morrow that was the way he felt to-day. But not only does it savor too much to my\n",
      "mind, grown old in practicality, of Aladdin’s lamp, but it would place\n",
      "us under an obligation to a republic on another continent which, it\n",
      "seems to me, is full of portent.” “The obligation is a personal one, your Majesty; and when we are in\n",
      "possession of Europe I think we will be in a position to force our own\n",
      "tariff conditions on the United States. Fessenden strode forward and stood in front of the table. “Well, sir, you will do nothing of the sort,” said Fessenden. The Emperor had fallen heavily into his chair. He is\n",
      "the ruler of a great empire, skilled in power and diplomacy. Always remember,” he said, “that I am no trafficker in human\n",
      "beings. Still, the time seemed long, and she had not\n",
      "the least idea by what method the American lover purposed to induce a\n",
      "Hapsburg to give him his daughter in marriage. Each one of the six thousand books in many\n",
      "languages looked as if personally selected by the poor gentleman\n",
      "and scholar who had graced so delightfully the one sphere for which\n",
      "Nature had designed him, and in whose alien rôle naught had become him\n",
      "but his death. The beauty of Elizabeth had retired to the\n",
      "inmost folds of her hideous Victorian costume, and of her two oldest\n",
      "babies, taken with her, little was noticeable but the bulging brow\n",
      "and solemn eyes of Rudolf. And then Maria Leopoldina felt\n",
      "as if her nerves had been assaulted by a swarm of hornets. Finally she was\n",
      "forced to conclude that, whatever Fessenden had accomplished in Vienna,\n",
      "his yacht had come without him. They were naïvely curious,\n",
      "and, face to face with the Archduchess beloved of their chief, frankly\n",
      "suspicious of the sequel. It was evident, however, that her information\n",
      "was more meagre than theirs, and they were so glad to get back to the\n",
      "tonic sweetness of the Adriatic after their fortnight at Venice, most\n",
      "malodorous of cities, and so enchanted with this beautiful princess and\n",
      "her castle, that they were content without knowledge, Yankees though\n",
      "they were. But before the\n",

      "Fessenden, who surely might have sent her a telegram. But visions and the past fled to their limbo. “That the Emperor has practically washed his hands of you, my dear, and\n",

      "hope you are duly thankful. No argument nor reasoning could move him. In so far as he\n",

      "vivid appreciation of all she was renouncing. She looked hard\n",

      "holding up his gown with both hands, while the gorgeous flunkies\n",
      "streamed with rain, the sight was not as imperial as it should have\n",
      "been, and two girls in an upper window giggled irreverently. The\n",

      "to occupy the state bedroom, lodging himself in the little camp-bed\n",
      "with its tentlike curtains, beloved of the sailor in Maximilian. The\n",
      "archdukes and ministers mumbled at each other; Fessenden and Ranata\n",
      "were many feet apart. For a time there was no conversation; then Fessenden placed his hands\n",
      "on her shoulders and held her from him, his eyes narrowing to a fiery\n",
